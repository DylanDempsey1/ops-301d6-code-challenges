# Create a new bash script that performs the following:

# Prompts user for input directory path.
# Prompts user for input permissions number (e.g. 777 to perform a chmod 777)
# Navigates to the directory input by the user and changes all files inside it to the input setting.
# Prints to the screen the directory contents and the new permissions settings of everything in the directory.

# Main

# Prompt user for input directory path
read -p "Please enter the directory path: " input_directory_path

# Prompt user for input permissions number
read -p "Please enter the permissions number (e.g., 777): " input_permissions

# Navigate to the directory input by the user
cd "$input_directory_path" || { echo "Error: Cannot navigate to directory."; exit 1; }

# Change permissions for all files inside the directory
find . -type f -exec chmod "$input_permissions" {} \;

# Print the directory contents and the new permissions settings
echo -e "\nDirectory contents and new permissions settings:"

for file in *; do
    if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
        file_permissions=$(stat -c "%A" "$file")
        echo "$file_permissions $file"
    fi
